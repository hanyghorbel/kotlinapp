# kotlinapp
An application that accesses the API located at "https://api.gameofthronesquotes.xyz/v1/random". the number of quotes to generate is dynamic. It is read from the user and passed as parameter in the url. As an example if the user puts 4 and taps on the Generate button the url from where to retrieve data would be "https://api.gameofthronesquotes.xyz/v1/random/4". The application handles errors and shows a loading component when retrieving data. It has two views: a main view and an Info view to check different informations from within the app.
